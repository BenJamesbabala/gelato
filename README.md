# About
Recent results in bayesian approach for constructing robust neural networks
have proved that it is one of the best ways to deal with uncertainty, overfitting
but still having good performance. Gelato will help to use bayes for neural networks.

Gelato heavily relies on [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano),
[Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) and [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3)
